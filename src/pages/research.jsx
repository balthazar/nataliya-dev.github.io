          <h2>Human-Robot Collaboration</h2>
          <p>
            We often see robots with hands, legs, torsos, and heads. Although they are designed to look like a person, we rarely see them behave like one, especially when getting a task done. The cold metallic exterior of a robot does not feel the presence of a human and prohibits it from physical contact. At the Human Interaction and Robotics Group (HIRO) in the Computer Science Department at CU Boulder, I research novel hardware and software technologies used to maximize the utility of robot embodiment to enhance natural human-robot cooperation. For example, instead of a numb surface robots will be equipped with sensor units that mimic skin. With this technology, I can study how the sense of touch enriches a robot's perception and self-awareness, allowing it to be more versatile and collaborative. I want to see robots widely employed in professional, domestic, and medical settings working alongside human companions.

          <h2>Grasp Planning</h2>
          <p>
            Humans possess a remarkable ability to grasp and recognize objects in the dynamic environments of everyday life. Inspired by this, the main goal of our research was to design robust and practical state-of-the-art solutions for robotic pick-and-place, a technology central to many applications: from picking packages in a logistics center to bin-picking in a manufacturing plant; from unloading groceries at home to clearing debris after a disaster.

          <h2>Underwater Robot Perception</h2>
          <p>
            The aim of our work was to endow underwater robots with the capability to observe the environment using cameras, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling.
