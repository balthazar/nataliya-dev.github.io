          <h2>Close-Proximity Human-Robot Collaboration</h2>
          <h4>
            We often see robots with hands, legs, torsos, and heads. Although they are designed to look like a person, we rarely see them behave like one, especially when getting a task done. The cold metallic exterior of a robot does not feel the presence of a human and prohibits it from physical contact. At the Human Interaction and Robotics Group (HIRO) in the Computer Science Department at CU Boulder, I research novel hardware and software technologies used to maximize the utility of robot embodiment to enhance natural human-robot cooperation. For example, instead of a numb surface robots will be equipped with sensor units that mimic skin. With this technology, I can study how the sense of touch enriches a robot's perception and self-awareness, allowing it to be more versatile and collaborative. I want to see robots widely employed in professional, domestic, and medical settings working alongside human companions.
